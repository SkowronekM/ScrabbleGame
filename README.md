# ScrabbleGame

The game "Scrabble" written in Python is a simply, basic version of the classic word game. The player can arrange words on the board, trying to score as many points as possible. During the game, the player can use various buttons such as "UNDO" to undo a move, "CHECK" to verify a word, and "REPLACE" to replace all letters he has with new ones. The game offers a simple user interface.

The game was written during the 4th semester of studies (2023) as one of the course final projects.
